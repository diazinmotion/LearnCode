## Overview
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Statically typed programming language for modern multiplatform applications. 100% interoperable with Java™ and Android™ created by <a href="https://tetbrains.com">JetBrains.</a>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a></dt>
  <dd>
    An open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side (Node.js) execution.

  <dd>
    Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

  <dd>
    Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.
    Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, and type inference. One of the most well-known usage of dart is flutter framework.
